import Cocoa

// Similar and different thing between Class and struct
/**
 // SIMILAR
 - You get to create and name then
 - you can add properties and methods, including property observers and access control
 - you can create custom initializer to configure new instance however you want
 
 // DIFFERENTS
 - You can make on class build upon functionality in another class, gaining all its properties and method as a starting point. If you want to selectively override some methods, you can do that too
 - Swift won't automatically generate a memberwise initializer for classes, you NEED to write your own initializer or assign default value to all your properties
 - when you copy an instance of a class. both share the same data.if you change one copy, other one also changes
 - when a final copy of a class instance is destroyed, Swift can OPTIONALLY run a special function called deinitializer
 - even if you make a class constant, you can still change its properties as long as they are variables

/**
Make a class hierarchy for animals, starting with Animal at the top, then Dog and Cat as subclasses, then Corgi and Poodle as subclasses of Dog, and Persian and Lion as subclasses of Cat.

But thereâ€™s more:
- The Animal class should have a legs integer property that tracks how many legs the animal has.
- The Dog class should have a speak() method that prints a generic dog barking string, but each of the subclasses should print something slightly different.
- The Cat class should have a matching speak() method, again with each subclass printing something different.
- The Cat class should have an isTame Boolean property, provided using an initializer.
