#  100 days of SwiftUI Challenge

Hi everyone, I am [Tuan Nguyen](https://anhtuank7c.github.io), I got laid off recently and I fall in love with Swift for a while but don't actual take it seriously.

Now I have a chance to seriously dig into it. I hope I could reach the goal and find a job to do SwiftUI at the end.

Thank you so much for your visit.
